# PatientQueue
Obstetrical Triage Management System: Develop a software system to manage the admission of patients into an obstetrical triage, serving as a digital queue for expectant mothers awaiting entry to the birthing unit.

Patient Class: Implement a Patient class to represent individual expectant mothers, including pertinent details likely related to signs of labor and admission time.

OTPRegister Class: Create an OTPRegister class to manage the FIFO queue, ensuring patients are processed in chronological order of their arrival.

Queue Functionality: Ensure the system adds new patients to the end of the queue and processes them sequentially, adhering to the first-in-first-out (FIFO) protocol.
